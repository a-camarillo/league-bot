# league-bot
 
This discord bot connects to the Riot API and fetches data for ranked statistics in League of Legends. Current commands for the bot return a player's rank, player's statistics from the past five ranked games, and a visual for player's champion distribution of the last twenty games with wins and losses, respectively.
