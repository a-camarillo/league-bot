# league-bot
 
This discord bot connects to the Riot API via RiotWatcher API wrapper and fetches data for ranked statistics in League of Legends. Current commands for the bot return a player's rank, player's statistics from the past five ranked games, and a visual for player's champion distribution of the last twenty games with wins and losses, respectively.

Check out the wrapper I used [here](https://github.com/pseudonym117/Riot-Watcher).
